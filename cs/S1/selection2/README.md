# C++ Selection Part 2
## Task 1 - Integer Calculator using if/else statements
The program takes as input two integers and the operation to be performed as a symbol (+, -, *, /, %). It the outputs the numbers, the operator, and the result. For division, if the denominator is zero, the program is aborted and an error message is displayed

## Task 2 - Floating Point Calculator with switch cases
This program does the same thing as Task 1, but it is more accurate because the input is taken as a float, not an int. Furthermore, switch cases are used in place of if then statements. 

## Task 3 - Grades
This program takes as input a number grade, and displays the corresponding letter grade and "Gen Z Rating". See the key below.

### Score Letter Grade and Rating Key: 
  | Score|Grade|Gen-Z Rating
--- | --- | --- | 
  | 90-100|A|Absolute Gigachad
  | 80-89|B|Based
  | 70-79|C|Mid
  | 60-69|D|Cringe
  | 0-59|F|Press F to pay respects.

## Execution
To use these programs, simply compile them and execute the compiled files. The files are called integerCalc.cpp, floatCalc.cpp, and Grades.cpp. I am assuming you know how to do this in c++.
